# bubble_sort
Project: Bubble Sort

One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])

=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
